Dockerized open source antivirus daemons for use with 
- file sharing containers like [Nextcloud](https://hub.docker.com/_/nextcloud/) or 
- to use it via a [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) proxy like [@solita](https://github.com/solita) made [clamav-rest](https://github.com/solita/clamav-rest) or
- to directly connect to *clamav* via TCP port `3310`

ClamAV daemon as a Docker image. It *builds* with a current virus database and
*runs* `freshclam` in the background constantly updating the virus signature database. `clamd` itself
is listening on exposed port `3310`.

# Releases
Find the latest releases at the official [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mkodockx/docker-clamav) registry. There are different releases for the different platforms.

# Usage
### Debian (default, :latest, :buster-slim, :stretch-slim)
- buster-slim
- stretch-slim
```bash
    docker run -d -p 3310:3310 mkodockx/docker-clamav:buster-slim
```

### Alpine (:alpine, :alpine-edge)
- alpine
- alpine-edge
```bash
    docker run -d -p 3310:3310 mkodockx/docker-clamav:alpine
```


Linked usage recommended, to not expose the port to "everyone".
```bash
    docker run -d --name av mkodockx/docker-clamav(:alpine)
    docker run -d --link av:av application-with-clamdscan-or-something
```

## Environment VARs
Thanks to @mchus proxy configuration is possible.
- HTTPProxyServer: Allows to set a proxy server
- HTTPProxyPort: Allows to set a proxy server port

Specifying a particular mirror for freshclam is also possible.
- DatabaseMirror: Hostname of the mirror web server.

## Persistency
Virus update definitions are stored in `/var/lib/clamav`. To store the defintion just mount the directory as a volume, `docker run -d -p 3310:3310 -v ./clamav:/var/lib/clamav mkodockx/docker-clamav:latest`

## docker-compose
See example with Nextcloud at [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/mko-x/docker-clamav/blob/master/docker-compose.yml). You still need to configure the *AntiVirus files* app in Nextcloud.
